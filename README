Release bundles can be downloaded from SourceForge.net:

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/mirutils/

Documentation is available at:

  http://mirutils.sourceforge.net
  
Quick Start:
  cd /path/to/install_directory/test  # e.g. /opt/mirUtils-version/test
  ../mirUtils ./data/mb_test_small.sort.bam
  
Note: 
  The mirUtils executable should not be moved from its bundle directory,
  as it uses relative paths to access its miRBase aritifacts in
  the mirbase sub-directory. For easier access, the bundle directory
  can be added to the PATH, or mirUtils can be invoked from a symbolic link.
